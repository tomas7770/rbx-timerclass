# Timer Class
Timer module made by [tomas7777](https://www.roblox.com/users/39995215/profile) for use in Roblox games.

Lets you create and manage OOP-like timers with ease. Includes events (that can be binded to callbacks) and useful functions for pausing, stopping, resetting and forcefully timing out timers. Supports creating fixed frequency loops that don't rely on wait(), run on a separate thread, and can be stopped at any time.
